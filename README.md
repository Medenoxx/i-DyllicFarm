# i-DyllicFarm
i-DyllicFarm is a Java backend project that showcases my Java programming skills through an engaging farm simulation game. This project is designed to highlight my proficiency in Java, including object-oriented programming, event handling, and interactive gameplay mechanics.

## Project Overview
i-DyllicFarm is an interactive farm management game where you can manage farm animals, feed them, harvest resources, and expand your farm by adding new animals. However, it’s not just about peaceful farming. there’s an element of strategy involved as you must protect your animals from a lurking wolf that attacks every three rounds. Your decisions during these attacks will determine the fate of your farm.

## Key Features
- **Animal Management:** Add, feed, and manage your farm animals to keep them healthy and productive.
- **Harvesting:** Collect resources from your animals to grow your farm's output.
- **Wolf Attacks:** Every three rounds, a wolf will appear and threaten your animals. Choose your strategy wisely to protect them!
- **Dynamic Gameplay:** Your decisions directly impact the survival and growth of your farm, with different outcomes based on your choices during wolf attacks.
## Technical Highlights
- **Java Programming:** Fully developed in Java, demonstrating core Java skills including object-oriented programming, classes, inheritance, and interfaces.
- **Event Handling:** Real-time events like feeding, harvesting, and attacks are managed through interactive event handling.
- **Strategy & Decision Making:** Players must make strategic decisions during wolf attacks, affecting farm resources and animal safety.
- **User Interaction:** Simple yet effective console-based interaction that showcases backend capabilities without a graphical user interface.
## Why i-DyllicFarm?
This project is for anyone looking to see a showcase of backend development in Java, combined with engaging gameplay mechanics that bring coding to life.
